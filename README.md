# Hypothesis-Testing-Developing-vs-Developed-Countries

This repository explores hypotheses related to the significance of various factors such as access to basic services, economic and social factors, and maternal mortality, in determining whether a country is developed and their contributions to life expectancy.

## Hypotheses

The project focuses on two primary hypotheses to test the significance of the factors in determining whether a country is developed and its life expectancy:

### 1. Hypothesis on Development Status of Countries

- **Null Hypothesis (𝐻0):**  
  𝛽_basic services = 𝛽_economic factors = 𝛽_maternal mortality = 0  
  Access to basic services, economic and social factors, and maternal mortality are **not** significant predictors of a country being developed.

- **Alternative Hypothesis (𝐻1):**  
  At least one of 𝛽_basic services, 𝛽_economic factors, 𝛽_maternal mortality ≠ 0  
  Access to basic services, economic and social factors, and maternal mortality are **significant** predictors of a country being developed.

### 2. Hypothesis on Life Expectancy

- **Null Hypothesis (𝐻0):**  
  𝛽_basic services = 𝛽_economic factors = 𝛽_maternal mortality = 0  
  Access to basic services, economic and social factors, and maternal mortality **do not** significantly contribute to life expectancy.

- **Alternative Hypothesis (𝐻1):**  
  At least one of 𝛽_basic services, 𝛽_economic factors, 𝛽_maternal mortality ≠ 0  
  Access to basic services, economic and social factors, and maternal mortality **significantly contribute** to life expectancy.

## Project Overview

This project conducts hypothesis testing using statistical models to analyze how factors such as basic services, economic factors, and maternal mortality influence the development status of countries and their life expectancy.

### Data

The data used in this project includes:
- Access to basic services (e.g., healthcare, education, sanitation)
- Economic and social factors (e.g., GDP, employment rates, literacy rates)
- Maternal mortality rates
- Life expectancy
